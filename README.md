# Plans2nite
Group 4

A mobile application that will provide a list suggesting restaurants, activities, or events in a specific location based on GPS. The list is meant to serve as a quick and easy way for the user to get suggestions on making plans for themselves or their group. The items on the list will factor in timing, price, popularity, and distance; whichever is most applicable to the user at the time.


## Main Home Screen

In our original user interface, our group intended to have a list view, map view, and filter. We were able to create the list view for our events. The map view and filter were left out due to simplicity. We would have liked to add this feature if more time was available.

## My Plans

We would have liked to add a fragmented view of tabs that would have included both Upcoming Plans and Past Plans. We have created a list view of upcoming plans that were registered by the user. Our next steps would have consisted of the tab view breakout and past plans.

## Profile

Currently, our profile is able to add user information to our database. We would have liked to incorporate an add picture function for our users if we had additional time.

## Functions to add:
- Map View of Events
- Filter Function
- Favorites List View
- Past Plans
- Groups/Friends
