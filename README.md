A mobile application that will provide a list suggesting restaurants, activities, or events in a specific location based on GPS. The list is meant to serve as a quick and easy way for the user to get suggestions on making plans for themselves or their group. The items on the list will factor in timing, price, popularity, and distance; whichever is most applicable to the user at the time.

## 1. How to Use

1. **Welcome Screen**: User will be prompted to select *Go To Login* or *Create New Event*. 
    - If the user selects *Go To Login* button, the user will be taken to the Login page. 
    - If the user selects *Create New Event*, the user will be taken to a page to insert an event.

2. **Login Screen**: User can either enter their login credentials or register as a new user using email and password. 
    - Sample Username: b@b.com 
    - Sample Password: bbbbbb

3. **Event List View Screen**: Plans are listed for the user. The user can then *register* for the event and it will we be saved to the upcoming plan page.

4. **Create Event Screen**: User will be able to enter name of event, date, location, event type, and event details. After submitting, the event will be added to the main list of events in the home page for the user to browse.

5. **My Plans**: User can see a list of all plans that they have registered for.

6. **My Profile**: User can enter name and other contact information. There the user can edit and save as well.

7. **Menu**: The menu allows navigation through entire app and ability to log out.

## 2. Future Implementation
### Main Home Screen

In our original user interface, our group intended to have a list view, map view, and filter. We were able to create the list view for our events. The map view and filter were left out due to simplicity. We would have liked to add this feature if more time was available.

### My Plans

We would have liked to add a fragmented view of tabs that would have included both Upcoming Plans and Past Plans. We have created a list view of upcoming plans that were registered by the user. Our next steps would have consisted of the tab view breakout and past plans.

### Profile

Currently, our profile is able to add user information to our database. We would have liked to incorporate an add picture function for our users if we had additional time.

### Functions to add:
- Map View of Events
- Filter Function
- Favorites List View
- Past Plans
- Groups/Friends
